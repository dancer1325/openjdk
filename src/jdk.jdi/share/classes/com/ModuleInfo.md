# Goal
* JDI
* `jdb`

# Java Debug Interface (JDI)
* == high level API /
  * provide 
    * information
      * about 
        * 👁️VM's (normally remote) 👁️
          * running state 
          * Class
          * Array
          * Interface
          * primitive types
          * primitive instances
      * useful for
        * debuggers
    * control | VM's execution
      * suspend & resume threads
      * set breakpoints
  * highest layer of JPDA 
* vs JDWP
  * recommended to use JDI |
    * debugger tools -- mainly, written in Java programming language --

# jdb
* := simple CL debugger

# Global Exceptions
* == exceptions / applied | entire API
  * -> NOT documented | individual methods
* TODO:
