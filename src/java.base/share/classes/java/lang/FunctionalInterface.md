* == informative annotation type 
  * uses
    * interface / annotate with it -- is a -- functional interface
    * 👁️ if a type is annotated with it -> you do NOT get a compilation error, unless 👁️
      * type is
        * an interface type
        * NOT 
          * annotation type
          * enum
          * class
      * annotated type -- satisfies -- functional interface requirements
    * if an interface fulfills the functional interface conditions (⚠️INDEPENDENTLY, it's annotated⚠️) -> compiler treats as a functional interface
