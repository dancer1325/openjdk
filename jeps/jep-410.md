## Summary

Remove the experimental Java-based ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compiler. This compiler has seen little use since its introduction and the effort required to maintain it is significant. Retain the experimental Java-level JVM compiler interface (JVMCI) so that developers can continue to use externally-built versions of the compiler for JIT compilation.

## Motivation

Ahead-of-time compilation (the`jaotc`tool) was incorporated into JDK 9 as an experimental feature viaJEP 295](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/295). The`jaotc`tool uses the Graal compiler, which is itself written in Java, for AOT compilation.

The Graal compiler was made available as an experimental JIT compiler in JDK 10 viaJEP 317](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/317).

We have seen little use of these experimental features since they were introduced, and the effort required to maintain and enhance them is significant. These features werenot included](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8255616)in the JDK 16 builds published by Oracle, and no one complained.

## Description

Remove three JDK modules:

- `jdk.aot`— the`jaotc`tool
- `jdk.internal.vm.compiler`— the Graal compiler
- `jdk.internal.vm.compiler.management`— Graal's`MBean`

Preserve these two Graal-related source files so that the JVMCI module (`jdk.internal.vm.ci`,JEP 243](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/243)) continues to build:

- `src/jdk.internal.vm.compiler/share/classes/module-info.java`
- `src/jdk.internal.vm.compiler.management/share/classes/module-info.java`

Remove HotSpot code related to AOT compilation:

- `src/hotspot/share/aot`— dumps and loads AOT code
- Additional code guarded by`#if INCLUDE_AOT`

Finally, remove tests as well as code in makefiles related to Graal and AOT compilation.

## Alternatives

Developers who wish to use the Graal compiler for either AOT or JIT compilation can useGraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org).

## Risks and Assumptions

We assume that developers actively using these features have had sufficient notice of this removal.
