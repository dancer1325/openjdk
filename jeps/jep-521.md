## Summary

Change the generational mode of the Shenandoah garbage collector from an experimental feature to a product feature.

## Non-Goals

It is not a goal to change the default mode of the Shenandoah collector. By default, Shenandoah will continue to use a single generation.

## Motivation

The generational mode of Shenandoah was integrated as an experimental feature byJEP 404](https://openjdk.org/jeps/404)in JDK 24.

Since then, we have implemented many stability and performance improvements. We have tested it extensively on multiple platforms with our own unit tests and with well-known benchmarks and workloads includingDaCapo](https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench),SPECjbb2015](https://www.spec.org/jbb2015/),SPECjvm2008](https://www.spec.org/jvm2008/), andHeapothesys](https://github.com/corretto/heapothesys). Several users have reported success running demanding workloads.

It is time to drop the generational mode’s experimental status.

## Description

In JDK 24, the generational mode of Shenandoah is enabled via the command-line options

```
$ java -XX:+UseShenandoahGC \
       -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions \
       -XX:ShenandoahGCMode=generational ...
```

The second option,`-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions`, will no longer be needed once the generational mode is a product feature.

We will not change any other options, or their default values.

We do not expect existing users to be impacted by this change. Removing the requirement to specify`-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions`does not make its presence on the command line an error, so existing users need not make any changes to continue using the generational mode.
