## Summary

Upgrade existing platform APIs to supportversion 8.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/)of theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

## Goals

Support the latest version of Unicode, with changes to the following classes:

- `Character`and`String`in the`java.lang`package,
- `NumericShaper`in the`java.awt.font`package, and
- `Bidi`,`BreakIterator`, and`Normalizer`in the`java.text`package.

## Non-Goals

Two related Unicode specifications will not be implemented by this JEP:

- UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm, and
- UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.

## Motivation

Unicode is an evolving industry standard, so we must keep Java to date with the latest version.

## Description

This is a follow-on toJEP 227](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/227), which introducedUnicode 7.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/)in JDK 9.Unicode 8.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/)adds an additional ~8,000 characters, 10 blocks, and 6 scripts.

## Testing

We will need to verify that the latest Unicode data is correctly used by the relevant classes.

## Risks and Assumptions

- 
Unicode 8 was released in June 2015. While fairly late in JDK 9 development, it is important to always implement the latest Unicode standard. Deferring until JDK 10 would put us more than three years behind.

- 
It's possible that a minor update to the Unicode Standard (e.g., 8.0.X) will be released before JDK 9 ships, in which case we may want to consider incorporating that version.

## Dependences

This feature depends on theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html)of the Unicode Consortium.
