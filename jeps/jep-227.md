## Summary

Upgrade existing platform APIs to supportversion 7.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/)of theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

## Goals

Support the latest version of Unicode, mainly in the following classes:

- `Character`and`String`in the`java.lang`package, and
- `Bidi`,`BreakIterator`, and`Normalizer`in the`java.text`package.

## Non-Goals

Two related Unicode specifications are not implemented by this JEP:

- UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm, and
- UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.

## Motivation

Unicode is an industry standard, so it's important for Java to support the latest version.

## Description

Java SE 8 supportsUnicode 6.2](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/).

This upgrade will include an improvement to bidirectional behavior, which enables better text display for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, that was introduced inUnicode 6.3](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/).Unicode 7.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/)itself will add about three thousand characters and over twenty scripts.

## Testing

We will need to verify that the latest Unicode data is correctly used by the relevant classes.

## Risks and Assumptions

If a version later than 7.0 is released in the JDK 9 time frame then this JEP will most likely be updated to specify that version.

## Dependences

This feature depends on theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html)of the Unicode Consortium.
