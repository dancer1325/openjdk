## Summary

Deprecate the Applet API for removal. It is essentially irrelevant since all web-browser vendors have either removed support for Java browser plug-ins or announced plans to do so.

## History

The Applet API was previously deprecated, though not for removal, byJEP 289](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/289)in Java 9.

## Description

Deprecate, for removal, these classes and interfaces of the standard Java API:

- `java.applet.Applet`
- `java.applet.AppletStub`
- `java.applet.AppletContext`
- `java.applet.AudioClip`
- `javax.swing.JApplet`
- `java.beans.AppletInitializer`

Deprecate, for removal, any API elements that reference the above classes and interfaces, including methods and fields in:

- `java.beans.Beans`
- `javax.swing.RepaintManager`
- `javax.naming.Context`

## Testing

Hundreds of tests need to be either modified or removed before the Applet API is removed, but this JEP is solely about deprecation-for-removal. We will review these tests to determine if further`@SuppressWarnings`annotations are required.

## Risks and Assumptions

In case remaining uses of these APIs do exist, developers can suppress compiler warnings via the`@SuppressWarnings("removal")`annotation or the`-Xlint:-removal`command-line option of the`javac`compiler.
