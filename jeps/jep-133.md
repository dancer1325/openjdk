## Summary

Extend existing platform APIs to support version 6.2 of theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

## Non-Goals

Two related Unicode specifications are not covered by this JEP:

- UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm
- UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing

## Description

Java SE 7 supports the Unicode Standard 6.0.0, which was the latest version of that standard at that time. After that we supportedUnicode 6.1.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/)released in February 2012 in JDK 8 and are now planning to supportUnicode 6.2.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/)released on September 2012.

Specifically, the following were the primary changes in Unicode 6.1.0:

- add 11 new blocks to`java.lang.Character.UnicodeBlock`,
- add 7 new scripts to`java.lang.Character.UnicodeScript`, and
- support over 700 new characters in`j.l.Character`,`String`, and other classes.

And the main change in Unicode 6.2.0 is to support a new Turkish currency sign(U+20BA).

## Testing

Need to verify that the latest Unicode data is correctly used by classes such as`java.lang.Character`,`java.lang.String`and`java.text.BreakIterator`.

## Risks and Assumptions

If a version newer than 6.2.0 is released in the JDK 8 time frame then this JEP will most likely be updated to specify that version.

## Dependences

This feature depends on theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html)of the Unicode Consortium.
