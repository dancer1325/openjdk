## Summary

Remove all of the sources related to the`arm64`port while retaining the 32-bit ARM port and the 64-bit`aarch64`port.

## Motivation

Removing this port will allow all contributors to focus their efforts on a single 64-bit ARM implementation, and eliminate the duplicate work required to maintain two ports.

## Description

Two 64-bit ARM ports exist in the JDK. The main sources for these are in the`src/hotspot/cpu/arm`and`open/src/hotspot/cpu/aarch64`directories. Although both ports produce`aarch64`implementations, for the sake of this JEP we shall refer to the former, which was contributed by Oracle, as`arm64`, and the latter as`aarch64`.

Here are the tasks that will be completed as part of this JEP:

- Remove all`arm64`-specific sources and`#ifdef`s related to 64-bit versus 32-bit builds in`open/src/hotspot/cpu/arm`
- Scan the remaining JDK sources for`#ifdef`s related to this port
- Remove the build option for building this port. Make the`aarch64`port the default build for the 64-bit ARM architecture.
- Validate that the remaining 32-bit ARM port continues to build and run the conformance tests with no regressions that did not exist prior to the changes related to this JEP.
