## Summary

Upgrade existing platform APIs to supportversion 10.0](http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/)of theUnicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

## Goals

Support the latest version of Unicode, mainly in the following classes:

- `Character`and`String`in the`java.lang`package,
- `NumericShaper`in the`java.awt.font`package, and
- `Bidi`,`BreakIterator`, and`Normalizer`in the`java.text`package.

## Non-Goals

Four related Unicode specifications will not be implemented by this JEP:

- UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm
- UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms
- UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing
- UTS #51, Unicode Emoji

## Motivation

Unicode is an evolving industry standard, so we must keep Java to date with the latest version.

## Description

Java SE 10 implements Unicode 8.0. Unicode 9.0 adds 7,500 characters and six new scripts, and Unicode 10.0.0 adds 8,518 characters and four new scripts. This upgrade will include the Unicode 9.0 changes, and thus will add a total of 16,018 characters and ten new scripts.
