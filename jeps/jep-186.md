## Summary

A*collection literal*is a syntactic expression form that evaluates to an aggregate type, such as an array,`List`, or`Map`. Many languages support collection literals. A`List`literal in Java might look like:

```
List<Integer> list = #[ 1, 2, 3 ];
```

Collection literals were proposed for Project Coin and naturally complement the library additions in Java SE 8. Collection literals can reduce boilerplate code, improve performance, and increase safety.

## Goals

This is a*research JEP*. The sole goal of this JEP is to explore the design space sufficiently to be able to propose a feature JEP (or recommend that the feature not be pursued.)

## Non-Goals

It is not a goal of this research JEP to produce a production-ready implementation or specification.

## Success Metrics

This research JEP will be judged successful if it produces a design that we wish to move forward to a feature JEP, or else certainty that we do not wish to proceed with this feature.

## Motivation

Collection literals can increase programmer productivity, code readability, and code safety.

## Description

Being able to initialize arrays, lists, sets, and maps with a compact expression offers many benefits, including:

- Clarity (smaller, simpler code);
- Dynamic footprint (the size is known, so a space-efficient implementation can be chosen); and
- Safety (the resulting object can be made immutable).

While a minimal solution that works for arrays,`List`s, and`Map`s would be "trivial", we would like to explore beyond such a simple-minded solution, leveraging target typing and which might enable an extensible set of types to exploit this feature.
