# Goals
* `Callable`
  * is a functional interface / `call()` is the abstract method
  * == task /
    * return a result &
    * -- may thrown an -- exception
  * used by many methods of `Executors`
  * vs `Runnable`  -- TODO: -- 

## How to run locally?
* Place the cursor at package declaration
* `javac share/classes/java/util/concurrent/Callable/Main.java` 
* `java share.classes.java.util.concurrent.Callable.Main`
  * execute several times / verify getting result or get an error
